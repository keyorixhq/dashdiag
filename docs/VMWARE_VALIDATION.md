# VMware-guest collector — validation runbook

Step-by-step plan to validate `dsd`'s VMware-guest checks on a **real VMware
guest** (the design-partner pilot's environment). Scope is guest-side only
(ADR-0002: Linux guest VMs IN; ESXi host / vSwitch OUT — not visible from inside
a guest).

The collector is `internal/collectors/vmware_linux.go`; the verdict logic is
`checkVMware` in `internal/analysis/heuristics.go`. Everything is gated behind
`VMwareGuestAvailable()` (DMI `sys_vendor`/`product_name` contains "vmware"), so
it is silent on non-VMware hosts.

## What each check does, and how to exercise it

| # | Insight | Fires when | Reproduce on a real guest | Expected output |
|---|---------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | gate (silent on non-VMware) | DMI is not VMware | run `dsd health` on the guest | a `VMware` line appears at all = gate fired |
| 2 | `WARN` tools not installed | `vmtoolsd` binary absent | `apt remove open-vm-tools` (or never install) | `open-vm-tools not installed … no time sync, quiesced backups, graceful shutdown, or ballooning` |
| 3 | `WARN` tools installed, not running | binary present, no `vmtoolsd` process | `apt install open-vm-tools && systemctl stop vmtoolsd` | `open-vm-tools installed but not running — quiesced snapshots/backups and graceful guest shutdown will fail` |
| 4 | `INFO` recognition (all clean) | tools running + no emulated NIC | `systemctl start vmtoolsd`, NIC = VMXNET3 | `VMware guest (<product>) — open-vm-tools running, paravirtual NIC drivers in use` |
| 5 | `WARN` emulated NIC | any NIC driver ∈ {e1000, e1000e, vlance, pcnet32} | in vSphere set the adapter type to **E1000**, reboot guest | `NIC(s) on an emulated driver (eth0 (e1000)) — vmxnet3 … higher throughput at lower host CPU` |

## Validation status (as of 2026-06-07)

Validated **live** on a KVM VM with spoofed VMware SMBIOS (pve01 VM 103,
192.168.10.63 — `sys_vendor="VMware, Inc."`, `product_name="VMware7,1"`):

- ✅ #1 gate fires; collector runs without crash; DMI product read.
- ✅ #2 tools-not-installed → WARN.
- ✅ #3 tools-installed-but-not-running → WARN (vmtoolsd inactive on KVM — no
  VMware backdoor).
- ✅ #4 INFO recognition — exercised by spoofing a `vmtoolsd`-named process
  (`cp /usr/bin/sleep /tmp/vmtoolsd && /tmp/vmtoolsd 600 &`) so the comm-name scan
  in `vmwareToolsRunning` matches; confirmed the INFO line renders.
- ✅ NIC driver read from `/sys/class/net/<if>/device/driver` (eth0 → virtio_net,
  correctly **not** flagged emulated — virtio is paravirtual).

**Still needs a real VMware guest** (the only remaining gaps):

- ⏳ #5 emulated-NIC WARN — the classification (`nicDriverEmulated`) is
  unit-tested, but no live host has an e1000 NIC: VM 103's cloud kernel lacks the
  `e1000` module. Confirm on real VMware that an E1000 adapter surfaces driver
  name `e1000` in `/sys` and trips the WARN; then flip to VMXNET3 and confirm it
  clears.
- ⏳ `vmw_pvscsi` / `vmw_balloon` module detection — needs a real VMware guest
  where those modules load. See open decision below.

## Recreate the KVM-spoof rig (no VMware needed)

VM 103 on pve01 ([[vmware-validation-vm]] in memory). The spoof:

```
qm set 103 --smbios1 manufacturer=<b64 "VMware, Inc.">,product=<b64 "VMware7,1">,base64=1
```

→ trips `VMwareGuestAvailable()`. Deploy `dsd`: build linux-amd64 → scp to pve01 →
scp pve01 → `debian@192.168.10.63:/tmp/dsd`. This rig validates everything except
the e1000 driver name and the pvscsi/balloon modules (which require real VMware
hardware/drivers).

## Real-VMware test procedure (when the resources land)

1. Provision a throwaway Linux guest (Debian/Ubuntu or RHEL-family) on vSphere.
2. Deploy `dsd` and run `dsd health` + `dsd health --json`. Confirm the `VMware`
   line appears (gate) — record the product string.
3. Walk rows #2–#5 above, changing one variable at a time and re-running
   `dsd health` after each, confirming the expected insight.
4. For #5: default adapter is often E1000 → expect the WARN immediately; switch to
   VMXNET3 in vSphere, reboot, confirm it clears to the #4 INFO.
5. Capture `dsd health --json` for the `vmware` object and verify
   `tools_installed`, `tools_running`, `nic_drivers`, `emulated_nics`,
   `pvscsi_loaded`, `balloon_loaded` reflect reality.

## Open decision — surface pvscsi / balloon?

`PVSCSILoaded` and `BalloonLoaded` are **collected but used in zero insights**
today (they appear only in `--json`). Options for the pilot:

- **Leave as JSON-only** — zero false-positive risk; the data is there for
  scripting but not in the human report.
- **Enrich the #4 INFO line** — e.g. append `paravirtual SCSI: yes; balloon:
  active` — informational, no WARN, demonstrates depth. Requires making
  `moduleLoaded` also check `/sys/module/<name>` so a **built-in** (non-module)
  `vmw_pvscsi`/`vmw_balloon` is not misreported as absent.
- **WARN on absence** — risky: many guests legitimately use the LSI Logic SAS
  controller (no pvscsi) by choice, so a "pvscsi not loaded" WARN would be noisy.
  Balloon-absent-while-tools-running is a safer WARN candidate.

Recommendation: **enrich the INFO line** (option 2) + the `/sys/module` robustness
fix, before the real test, so the test validates the final intended behavior.
Founder to confirm.
